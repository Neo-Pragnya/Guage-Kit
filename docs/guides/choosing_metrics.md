# Choosing Metrics for Evaluation

When evaluating LLMs, RAG systems, and embeddings, selecting the right metrics is crucial for obtaining meaningful insights. This guide provides an overview of the available metrics and considerations for choosing the most appropriate ones for your evaluation needs.

## 1. Understanding the Types of Metrics

### LLM Quality Metrics
These metrics assess the quality of language model outputs. Common metrics include:
- **ROUGE**: Measures the overlap of n-grams between generated text and reference text.
- **BLEU**: Evaluates the quality of text which has been machine-translated from one language to another.
- **METEOR**: Considers synonyms and stemming, providing a more nuanced evaluation than BLEU.

### RAG Quality Metrics
These metrics evaluate the performance of retrieval-augmented generation systems:
- **Faithfulness**: Measures how accurately the generated output reflects the retrieved context.
- **Answer Relevancy**: Assesses the relevance of the generated answer to the query.

### Embedding Metrics
These metrics are used to evaluate the quality of embeddings:
- **STS Spearman**: Measures the correlation between semantic textual similarity scores and human judgments.
- **Clustering Metrics**: Evaluate the quality of clusters formed by embeddings, such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).

## 2. Considerations for Choosing Metrics

### Evaluation Goals
Define what you want to achieve with your evaluation. Are you interested in the quality of generated text, the relevance of retrieved information, or the effectiveness of embeddings? Your goals will guide your metric selection.

### Metric Characteristics
Consider the characteristics of each metric:
- **Sensitivity**: How well does the metric capture subtle differences in quality?
- **Interpretability**: Is the metric easy to understand and explain to stakeholders?
- **Computational Efficiency**: How resource-intensive is the metric to compute?

### Context of Use
The context in which the model will be used can influence metric selection. For example, if the model is intended for a high-stakes application, metrics that assess safety and bias may be particularly important.

## 3. Recommended Metric Combinations

For a comprehensive evaluation, consider using a combination of metrics from different categories. For example:
- Use LLM quality metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU) alongside RAG quality metrics (e.g., Faithfulness, Answer Relevancy) to assess both the generation and retrieval aspects of your system.
- Incorporate embedding metrics (e.g., STS Spearman) to evaluate the quality of the embeddings used in your model.

## 4. Conclusion

Choosing the right metrics is essential for effective evaluation. By understanding the types of metrics available and considering your evaluation goals, you can select the most appropriate metrics to gain valuable insights into your models' performance.
